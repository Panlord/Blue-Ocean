# Motivation

Upon completion of this project, the application will provide a social platform for users to listen to music together online. Friends will be able to hang out in a room and add songs to a queue. As they listen to music in sync, they can type in a shared room chat and like/dislike and save songs in the room’s queue.


# Features

- **Party/Group Room:** Users will be able to create a room and play music. The host can invite friends with a link to join the room. The room will display the current song playing, the user who is playing the current song, and the room host.

- **Song Queue:** Users will be able to add and skip songs in a queue. The queue will show the order of the songs and display the username next to their song choice. Admins will be able to open/close the queue. When closed, the queue can only be modified by the host and admins. Users will be able to like and dislike songs in the current queue, and save songs to their own “Liked” playlist.

- **Room Settings:** The room will have settings that include options for privacy (only users with access to the link can join), queue, and admin delegation. To start off, the room will have a limit of 8 users. This may increase if performance allows it.

- **Group/Party/Room Chat:** The room will have a group chat where users in the room can engage in conversation through sending and receiving messages. Senders’ usernames will be displayed with their messages. Messages can be sent by either pressing the enter key on the keyboard or by clicking a send button.

- **Spotify API:** The application will connect to Spotify API. Upon entering the page, users will be required to login with a spotify account.

# Instructions for development

## Working on your branch
The [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) assumes *one central repository* and the `main` branch represents the official project history.
Instead of committing directly to your local `main` branch, create a **new** branch to work on a **particular feature**. Feature branches should have *descriptive names* (e.g., “animated-menu-items”).
Feature branches can (and *should*) be pushed to the central repository (on GitHub). The only *special* branch is `main`. **Don’t ever push anything to** `main`! The following is a brief overview of how to do your work:
### 1. Start with the main branch
All feature branches are created off the latest code state of a project. Assume that the `main` branch on GitHub is always up-to-date. First, check out the `main` branch on your machine, pull the latest updates, and reset the repo’s local copy of `main` to match the latest version:
```
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
### 2. Create a new feature branch
Use a **separate branch for each feature/issue you work on**. You can create a branch and check it out in one command as follows:
```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
### 3. Update, add, and commit changes
**On your feature branch**, you can edit, stage, and commit changes as usual.
```
git status
git add some_file
git commit -m “Some descriptive message--better messages help when we need to undo changes”
```
### 4. Push feature branch to remote (GitHub)
When ready, push your commits, updating the feature branch on GitHub. It’s a good idea to push the feature branch up to the central repository so we can see what you’re doing. To push `new-branch-name` to the central repository (GitHub), issue:
```
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```
**NOTE**: The `-u` flag adds the local branch you created in step 2 as a remote tracking branch. After setting up the tracking branch, `git push` can be invoked without any parameters to automatically push the `new-branch-name` branch to the central repo (GitHub).
### 5. Done implementing the feature? Create a pull request!
When you’ve finished implementing and testing the feature your branch was created to work on, create a pull request through GitHub.
## Running your code
1. Make sure you’re working on the correct branch!
2. Open two terminal tabs and navigate to the root directory.
3. In one tab, run `npm start` to start the node server, which serves up static files from the /client/dist directory.
4. In the second tab, run `npm run react-dev`, which uses webpack to regenerate the `bundle.js` file when you save changes to one of your components.
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

# Semantic Commit Messages

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
